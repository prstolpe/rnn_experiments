# RNNs in the view of dynamical systems

This repository will contain a set of tools to analyse and understand recurrent
neural networks. Some of the tools relate to rnns as dynamical systems while others 
will aim at understanding their computation by means of their transformations. 

The first ready to use tool, the fixedpointfinder, can be found in this package:
[fixedpointfinder](fixedpointfinder).

# Getting started

For usage in other projects, I recommend using [`git submodules`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
From your current project directory execute:  
`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ccnmaastricht/rnn_dynamical_systems.git`
